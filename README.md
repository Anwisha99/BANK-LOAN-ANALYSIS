# Bank Loan Growth Analysis

This repository showcases my Bank Loan Analytics Project, where I analyzed customer loan data to evaluate the bank's growth trends over several years. The project demonstrates my proficiency in SQL for data analysis and Excel for visualization and reporting.

# Project Overview

The project involved analyzing two large datasets to uncover trends in loan growth and provide actionable insights for stakeholders.

## Datasets
  - Format: CSV files.
  - Size: Over 39,000 rows each of customer loan data, including details on loan amounts, customer demographics, and disbursement dates.
## Objective
  - Primary Goal: Analyze and evaluate the growth in bank loans over a given period.
  - Deliverables: Insights on loan growth trends, key customer segments, and actionable recommendations for decision-making.

# Tools and Technologies Used
  ## SQL:

      - Extracted, cleaned, and transformed the data.
      - Performed exploratory analysis to identify patterns and trends.
  ## Excel:

     - Built comprehensive and interactive visualizations to represent loan growth, customer trends, and year-over-year performance.
     - Used pivot tables, charts, and conditional formatting for enhanced reporting.
     
## Project Workflow

  ## 1. Data Preparation
        - Imported the raw datasets into SQL for analysis.
        - Conducted data cleaning:
        - Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
        - Standardized date formats for time-series analysis.
        - Joined and filtered data to extract meaningful subsets.
  ## 2. Data Analysis
         - Performed trend analysis to evaluate loan growth over time.
         - Identified key metrics, such as:
         - Year-over-Year Growth Rate.
         - Average Loan Size by Customer Segment.
         - Loan Distribution Across Regions.
         - Highlighted high-performing and underperforming regions.
  ## 3. Data Visualization
       - Exported the processed data into Excel for visualization.
       - Created:
       - Dynamic Pivot Tables: For slicing and dicing data by year, region, and customer type.
       - Trend Charts: To display growth rates and key patterns over time.
       - Summary Dashboards: Comprehensive overviews of insights using conditional formatting and slicers.

  ## Key Insights
  
      - Loan Growth: Identified consistent year-over-year growth in loans, with a notable peak in [specific year].
      - Customer Segments: Highlighted top-performing customer segments contributing to the majority of loans.
      - Regional Trends: Revealed disparities in loan performance across regions, providing actionable insights for targeted strategies.
